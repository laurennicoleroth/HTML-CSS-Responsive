# Responsive HTML & CSS Resume

We will be building a responsive resume using HTML & CSS. What this means is that the design itself will "respond" to different screen sizes. We will code from scratch using a responsive resume design. Feel free to have fun with it and customize it for yourself or a celebrity you find interesting.

			The new section element defines a part of a website with related content. It should not be used as a generic container element or for pure styling purposes. In that case rather use a simple div.

			An article defines an independent piece of content which should be able to stand alone and still make sense.

			A header defines a header for a document or a section.

			A footer is used for defining the footer of a document or a section.

			A nav defines a set of navigation links which should be the main navigation of your website.

			An aside defines a section with secondary content. If an aside is placed within an article the content should be related to that specific article. If it is placed outside an article the content should be related to the site as whole.
